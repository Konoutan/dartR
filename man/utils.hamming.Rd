\title{Calculates the Hamming distance between two DArT trimmed DNA sequences}
\usage{
utils.hamming(str1, str2)
}

\item{str1}{-- string containing the first sequence [required]}

\item{str2}{-- string containing the second sequence [required]}
}
\value{
Hamming distance between the two strings
}
\description{
The Hamming distance between the rows of a matrix can be computed fast, 
by exploiting the fact that the dot product of two binary vectors x and (1 â€“ y) 
counts the corresponding elements that are different between x and y.
Matrix multiplication can also be used for matrices with more than two possible 
values, and different types of elements.
}
\details{
The function calculates the Hamming distance between all columns of a 
matrix X, or two matrices X and Y. Again matrix multiplication is used, this
time for counting, between two columns x and y, the number of cases in which 
corresponding elements have the same value (e.g. A, C, G or T). This counting 
is done for each of the possible values individually, while iteratively adding 
the results. The end result of the iterative adding is the sum of all 
corresponding elements that are the same, i.e. the inverse of the Hamming 
distance. Therefore, the last step is to subtract this end result H from the 
maximum possible distance, which is the number of rows of matrix X.

If the two DNA sequences are of differing length, the longer is truncated.

The algorithm is that of Johann de Jong
