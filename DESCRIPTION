Description: Functions are provided that facilitate the import and analysis of
    snp and silicodart (presence/absence) data. The main focus is on data generated by DarT (Diversity Arrays Technology).
    However, once SNP or related fragment presence/absence data from any source is imported into a genlight object
    many of the functions can be used.
    Functions are available for input and output of snp and silicodart data, for reporting on and filtering on various
    criteria (e.g. CallRate, Heterozygosity, Reproducibility, maximum allele frequency). Advanced filtering is based on
    Linkage Disequilibrium and HWE. Other functions are available for visualization after PCoA,  or to facilitate 
    transfer of data between genlight/genind objects and newhybrids, related, phylip packages etc.
