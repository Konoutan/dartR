#' Calculates the Hamming distance between two DArT trimmed DNA sequences
#'
#' The Hamming distance between the rows of a matrix can be computed fast, 
#' by exploiting the fact that the dot product of two binary vectors x and (1 â€“ y) 
#' counts the corresponding elements that are different between x and y.
#' Matrix multiplication can also be used for matrices with more than two possible 
#' values, and different types of elements.
#'
#' The function calculates the Hamming distance between all columns of a 
#' matrix X, or two matrices X and Y. Again matrix multiplication is used, this
#' time for counting, between two columns x and y, the number of cases in which 
#' corresponding elements have the same value (e.g. A, C, G or T). This counting 
#' is done for each of the possible values individually, while iteratively adding 
#' the results. The end result of the iterative adding is the sum of all 
#' corresponding elements that are the same, i.e. the inverse of the Hamming 
#' distance. Therefore, the last step is to subtract this end result H from the 
#' maximum possible distance, which is the number of rows of matrix X.
#' 
#' If the two DNA sequences are of differing length, the longer is truncated.
#'
#' The algorithm is that of Johann de Jong
